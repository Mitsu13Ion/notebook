      If you already have an account on Notebook.ai, you can skip this step &mdash; just log into your existing account.
      If you don't have an account, it takes about 30 seconds to create one.

    <% if user_signed_in? %>
      <p>
        Now that you're signed into a Notebook.ai account, you can paste the code you received from SaS Con 2021 into the box below.
        Your account will be immediately upgraded to Premium (<span class="grey-text">normally $9/month</span>) for 2 months.
      </p>
      <div>
        <%= form_for :promotional_code, url: redeem_path do |form| %>
          <div class="input-field col s12 m6">
            <%= form.text_field :promo_code %>
            <label for="promo_code">Code</label>
          </div>
          
          <div class="input-field col s12 m6">
            <%= form.submit 'Redeem code', class: 'white black-text btn' %>
          </div>
        <% end  %>
      </div>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <% else %>
      <p>
        Once you've signed into a Notebook.ai account, you can paste the code you received from SaS Con 2021 into the box below.
        Your account will be immediately upgraded to Premium (<span class="grey-text">normally $9/month</span>) for 2 months.
      </p>
      <div>
        <%= form_for :promotional_code, url: redeem_path do |form| %>
          <div class="input-field col s12 m6">
            <%= form.text_field :promo_code, disabled: 'disabled' %>
            <label for="promo_code">Code</label>
          </div>
          
          <div class="input-field col s12 m6">
            <%= form.submit 'Redeem code', class: 'white black-text btn', disabled: 'disabled' %>
          </div>
        <% end  %>
      </div>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
    <% end %>
    <p>
      At the end of the 2 months, you will be automatically downgraded back to the free Starter tier and won't be charged again. 
      <strong>
        You will have full access all pages you create, forever
      </strong>
      &mdash; once you create them, you're <em>your</em> pages; we just host them for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, you can also upgrade again at any time in the future by clicking "Billing" in the sidebar and
      selecting a Premium plan that works for you.
    </p>

    <div style="font-size: 1.3em;">Step 3: Enjoy Premium!</div>
    <p>
      Premium unlocks a ton of new kinds of pages for you to create in Notebook.ai, which let you get super specific when creating your
      fictional worlds. You can browse the available page types and turn them on for your universe by clicking "Add more..." in your 
      logged-in notebook sidebar, or simply <%= link_to 'click here', customization_content_types_path %> to get started. You can also see
      a quick sampling below.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 1.5em; padding-top: 100px; font-weight: bold" id="how-to-redeem">Notebook pages available with Premium</div>
<p>
  Create any of these pages &mdash; and as many as you need &mdash; to start putting ideas to paper and flesh your world out one piece at a time.
  Each page comes with a fully-customizable template that will ask you questions to get you started, but stay out of your way when you've got your
  momentum.
