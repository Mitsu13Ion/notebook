## Fixing Bugs

Check out our [issue tracker] and see what we're working on.
We also keep ideas in there, and you are welcome to jump into the conversation.

## Adding and updating features

Please [create a pull request][pr] to implement features you'd like to see.
GitHub Actions builds every pull request,
so we'll have prompt feedback on the progress of the feature implementation.
We require a few things in order to merge a pull request:

 - You must merge `master`'s latest commit
 - There must be no merge conflicts
 - Your new feature must be covered by tests
 - The test build must pass
